# GTD-Terrorism-Trends-Analysis
Analyzes confirmed terrorist attacks from 2007–2017 using the Global Terrorism Database. Visualizations highlight trends in fatalities, weapon usage, and regional impact, providing data-driven insights into global terrorism patterns.

📌 Project Description

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) with the objective of identifying trends in terrorist activity across time, regions, attack types, and groups. The analysis focuses on the period from 2007 to 2017 and uses data visualization and aggregation techniques to derive meaningful insights.

📂 Dataset

Source: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
Time Period: 2007–2017
Scope: Worldwide terrorist incidents

⚠️ Assumptions

To maintain analytical consistency, the following assumptions were applied:

Only confirmed terrorist attacks were included
Incidents with unknown fatality counts were assumed to have zero deaths
Rare weapon categories (biological, radiological, fake weapons) were excluded
Note: Results should be interpreted as lower-bound estimates of the true impact.

📊 Key Analysis Areas

The analysis focuses on:
Fatalities over time and their surge after 2014
Attack patterns by weapon and attack type
Regional concentration of terrorist incidents
Geographical distribution of attacks by major terrorist groups
